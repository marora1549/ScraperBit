## Task Details and Progress Notes

### MoneyControl Scraper Implementation with Playwright
- Completely reimplemented the MoneyControl scraper using Playwright to handle JavaScript-rendered content
- Added special scraping logic for extracting stock recommendations from the dynamic content
- Implemented structure based on the actual HTML elements from MoneyControl website
- Created both synchronous and asynchronous interfaces for Playwright integration
- Enhanced extraction of stock symbols, company names, prices, recommendation types, and research links
- Implemented robust error handling and logging
- Added fallback mechanisms if Playwright is not available

### Growth Filter Removal - Completed
- Updated the `filter_target_growth` function in `data_processing.py` to process rather than filter
- Removed filtering but kept calculation of growth percentage
- Updated all references to this function in `run_stock_scrapers.py`

### JSON Output Format - Completed
- Updated `save_results` function in `run_stock_scrapers.py` to focus only on JSON output
- Removed CSV generation and related code
- Simplified report generation to focus on JSON format for eventual API use

### Next Steps
- Test each scraper independently to verify functionality
- Test the complete workflow with all scrapers in the consolidated system
- Update documentation to reflect the changes made
