# ScraperBit Project Planning

## Project Objective
Develop a specialized stock leads scraper system that extracts potential investment opportunities from financial websites, focusing on identifying stocks with 7-15% growth potential.

## System Architecture

### Core Components
1. **Web Scraping Engine**: Handles fetching content from financial websites with anti-blocking capabilities
2. **Data Extraction Module**: Parses HTML content to extract stock details
3. **Data Processing Module**: Filters and processes extracted stock information
4. **Results Management**: Saves and presents the extracted information

### Modular Design (Implemented)
1. **Base Module (base_scraper.py)**: Core functionality, utility functions, and common scraping methods
2. **Website-Specific Scrapers (scrapers/*.py)**: Individual scraper modules for each financial website
3. **Data Processing (data_processing.py)**: Functions for filtering, scoring, and organizing extracted stock data
4. **Runner Module (run_stock_finder.py)**: Main execution script that coordinates the scraping process

## Current Status & Next Phases

### Phase 1: Initial Setup & Core Implementation (Completed âœ…)
- Project structure created
- Core functionality implemented
- Initial website testing completed

### Phase 2: Modularization (Completed âœ…)
- Modular architecture implemented
- Specialized scrapers for Economic Times, LiveMint, 5paisa, and MoneyControl created
- Verification testing system implemented

### Phase 3: Scraper Refinement (Current Phase ðŸ”„)
- Debug and fix existing scrapers that aren't working (0/3 completed)
- Analyze website structures in detail to improve extraction logic
- Implement more robust fallback mechanisms
- Enhance text analysis for better stock recommendation detection

### Phase 4: Expansion (Next Phase)
- Implement specialized scrapers for remaining financial websites (0/8 completed)
- Create a generic scraper for unknown websites
- Focus on sites with structured data first, then move to more complex ones

### Phase 5: System Integration & Optimization
- Ensure all scrapers work together correctly
- Optimize performance and reliability
- Create comprehensive reporting system
- Implement error monitoring and notification system

## Technical Requirements
- Python 3.x
- BeautifulSoup for HTML parsing
- Pandas for data management
- Concurrent processing for improved performance
- Anti-blocking measures for reliable web access

## Growth Potential Focus
- Implement specific filters to identify stocks with 7-15% growth potential
- Calculate and prioritize stocks within this growth range
- Enhance confidence scoring to favor stocks in the target growth range

## Website-Specific Strategies

### Working Websites:
1. **5paisa**: Utilizes table structures for clean data extraction. Continue using this approach.

### Non-Working Websites - Improvement Strategies:
1. **Economic Times**: 
   - Implement multiple parsing approaches
   - Focus on detecting price patterns in text
   - Extract data from tables when available
   - Consider using more aggressive text analysis

2. **LiveMint**: 
   - Improve text analysis for stock recommendations
   - Use more flexible pattern matching
   - Focus on paragraphs that contain both stock names and price information

3. **MoneyControl**: 
   - Address potential anti-scraping measures
   - Implement more specialized text parsing
   - Use multiple fallback mechanisms

## Testing & Verification Process
1. Individual website testing with test_url.py
2. Debug information extraction with debug scripts
3. Verification of extracted data quality
4. Comprehensive testing across all websites
